    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are specific scenarios that a user may encounter depending on what they want. When writing user stories, it is from the perspective of the user, so the user is centered when writing them. This helps make sure that a user's needs are addressed.

    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The Agile principle of adaptibility is incredibly important in programming. Being able to pivot to another method to solve a problem when one isn't working out is essential to debugging. Breaking down work into individual action items (like user stories) makes the workload more manageable, and always having a working product is a life saver at school, and keeps things on track at work.

    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good Agile team member is adaptible, attentive to the needs of their team, and proactive about their own preferences and needs. Adaptibility helps a team member not dig themself into a hole, collaboration is important and collaboration is easier if one is in sync with their team members, and nothing that needs to change will change and nothing that needs addressed will be addressed if no one speaks up.
